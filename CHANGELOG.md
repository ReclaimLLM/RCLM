# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- Added historical session backfill via `rclm-sync`, with discovery support for Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI transcripts.
- Added installer-driven sync onboarding so `rclm-hooks-install` can offer an immediate upload of existing sessions after hooks are installed.
- Added DLP support for `.env`-style files, including env-file detection, secret parsing, input redaction for Claude reads, shell-read blocking for Claude Bash usage, output scrubbing across supported providers, and temp-file cleanup for sanitized reads.
- Added sync-aware uploads with `HookSessionRecord.is_sync` so the server can distinguish historical imports from live captures.
- Added tests for DLP behavior and historical sync discovery/parsing flows.

### Changed
- Updated Claude, Gemini, and Codex hook handlers to support DLP-driven response rewriting without breaking provider hook contracts.
- Updated Gemini hook output handling so hook-specific JSON can be returned when a tool response is scrubbed.
- Extended uploader retry configuration so sync paths can cap retries independently of live-session uploads.
- Updated installer flags and persisted config handling to support `--dlp` alongside existing hook installation options.
- Expanded project documentation and architecture notes to cover historical sync, DLP behavior, provider coverage, and the new `rclm-sync` entry point.

### Internal
- Added the `rclm-sync` console script to package entry points.
- Renamed installer URL constants for clearer frontend/backend separation.
- Ignored local `diff.txt` scratch output in Git.
